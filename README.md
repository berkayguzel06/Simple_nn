## Introduction

This project is a simple neural network framework implemented in Python using the numpy library. It provides a basic structure for creating, configuring, and training neural networks.

[Optional: Add a brief description of the project's purpose, goals, and features.]

## Features

- Create and configure multi-layer neural networks
- Implement various activation functions (Sigmoid, ReLU, Softmax, etc.)
- Support multiple cost functions (Cross-Entropy, Quadratic, etc.)
- Basic backpropagation algorithm for training
- [Optional: Other notable features]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this framework, you need to have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- numpy (>=1.0)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-framework.git
   cd neural-network-framework

Usage
Creating a Network
To create a neural network, import the Network class and instantiate it:

from neural_network_framework import Network

network = Network()

Adding Layers
You can add layers to your network using the Layer class. Specify the number of input units and neurons in each layer, as well as the desired activation and cost functions:
from neural_network_framework import Layer

layer1 = Layer(inputs=input_size, neurons=hidden_size, activation='SigmoidFunction', cost='CrossEntropyCost')
layer2 = Layer(inputs=hidden_size, neurons=output_size, activation='SoftmaxFunction', cost='CrossEntropyCost')

Training
Train your network using the fit method, passing input data and target labels:
network.fit(input_data)
